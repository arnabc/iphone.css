iPhone.css
==========

Why build natively when you can build web and make it appear native. Use this CSS file (iphone.css) as a basis for building iPhone looking apps with PhoneGap (or without, up to you). Eventually I will add iphone-retina.css and ipad.css if I get time, otherwise, that sounds like a great "opportunity" for fortune and fame* *wink wink*. 

Please fork and help to provide a single style sheet that can just be dropped in. I have zepto included for the example just to show how items change on touch/click events (note it is now on click, but should be touchstart for "responsiveness")

<script src="iphone.css">

With <3,

Chris
